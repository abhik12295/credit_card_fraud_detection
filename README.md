## Credit Card Kaggle Anamoly Detection
### Isolation Forest has a 99.74% more accurate than Linear Regression of 93.4%.<br>
### So overall Isolation Forest Method performed much better in determining the fraud cases.<br>
### We can also improve on this accuracy by increasing the sample size or use deep learning algorithms however at the cost of computational expense.We can also use complex anomaly detection models to get better accuracy in determining more fraudulent cases.<br>
